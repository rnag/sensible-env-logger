## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `sensible-env-logger` for local development.

1. Fork the `sensible-env-logger` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/sensible-env-logger.git
    ```
3. Create a branch for local development:
    ```shell
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```
   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests:
    ```shell
    $ cargo test
    ```
5. If necessary, create a new Rust script under the `examples/` folder which
   demonstrates usage of the new feature.

   Then, run the new example script to confirm that it works as intended:
    ```shell
    $ cargo run --example my_awesome_example
    ```
6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
    ```shell
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```
7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`).

*First-time only*: to update `git push` to push both the commits and tags simultaneously, run this command
as mentioned in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3745135/push-git-commits-tags-simultaneously):

```shell
$ git config --global push.followTags true
```

Then run:
```shell
$ cargo bump patch --git-tag # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
```

GitHub Actions will then deploy to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) if tests pass,
once code is merged to the `main` branch.
